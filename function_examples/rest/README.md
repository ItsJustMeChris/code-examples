# Rest

This is a basic example of a function that when called, makes a request to a rest API using `node-fetch`, and returns a portion of the response back to the client.

It includes an `index.html` that makes the call and displays the response.

This function gets data from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/, and also has a build process.
