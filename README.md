# Getting started with Netlify Functions üêë

## Intro

As developers, we can't emphasize more the [benefits](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) of AWS Lambda functions.

With [Netlify Functions](https://www.netlify.com/docs/functions/), you can now deploy AWS Lambda functions on Netlify without configuring API gateways, coordinating deployments or setting up an AWS account. Just add each function as a file in your Git repository and Netlify will take care of the rest.

## Basic code examples

To help you quickly get started, we hereby included several simple code examples under `functions_examples` folder to showcase the basic usage of Netlify Functions. Detailed instructions enclosed under each subfolder.

## Further exploration

For a more comprehensive tutorial, this enlightening [example](https://github.com/alexmacarthur/netlify-lambda-function-example) will walk you through the thought process step by step. Thanks to our user [alexmacarthur](https://github.com/alexmacarthur/netlify-lambda-function-example/commits?author=alexmacarthur).

If you're curious about a more advanced use case or integrating with other Netlify add-on features, such as [Identity](https://www.netlify.com/docs/identity/) and [Form handling](https://www.netlify.com/docs/form-handling/), Checkout these tutorials:
